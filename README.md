- 👋 Hi, I’m @davytautas!
- 👀 I’m interested in music, programming, learning new languages (human and programming) and meeting new, interesting people who can introduce me to a new perspective on things, 
no matter how little.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, with a strong interest in learning a low-level language to follow it and some HTML + CSS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... probably not much for now! I'm still very much a newcomer to all of this, so I'd like to get some more experience before jumping into projects.
- 📫 Feel free to dm me on here or email me at danijoe0804@gmail.com, I tend to check it at least twice a week.
