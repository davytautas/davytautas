- 👋 Hi, I’m @davytautas!
- 👀 I’m interested in music, programming, learning new languages (human and programming) and meeting new, interesting people who can introduce me to a new perspective on things, 
no matter how little.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, with a strong interest in learning a lower-level language like javascript to follow it and some HTML + CSS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve mainly Python, for now! While I am very eager to start exploring other CS fields, languages, engines and different ways to develop I'm currently aiming to solidify my Python skills before jumping into something new.
- 📫 Feel free to dm me on here, I tend to check it every once in a while.
